# Coding-Quiz
The objective of this challenge is to create timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. If the user gets an answer wrong they will be penalized by losing time off the clock. The test will end when either the user answers all questions or the timer reaches 0. At which point the user can save their initials and scores. 

## Challenges making the Coding Quiz
I faced many challenges making this quiz. So far in the bootcamp JavaScript has been more difficult for me to learn than HTML and CSS. It was a challenge to figure how to properly display the questions (titles, and answers) in order back to back. 

I ran out of time and was unable to hide the other elements on the html page to then become unhidden at other points after the quiz ended.
